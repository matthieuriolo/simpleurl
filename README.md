About
-----
SimpleURL is a tokenizer written in C. The main goal was to design a real simple API for accessing URL informations. The library does not use any regular expression but instead the common string functions from C. You should mind that the library does none validation on the given string!

Documentation
-----
The documenation can be found in the folder wiki. You need to access the files as a raw text file because the used wiki syntax on code.google was not markup (as it is on github)
